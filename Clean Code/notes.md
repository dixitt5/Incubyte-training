# Clean Code

- Always use proper variable names even if it's longer.
- Use less function params.
- functions should be less long, cannot exceed more than 20 lines.
- don't repeat yourself. (create function or diff component for duplicate lines rather than writing for more than once)
- split regex into multiple variables if it's long.
- don't use magic numbers (static hardcoded values), convert it into a variable with desc name.
- read uncle bob's book.
