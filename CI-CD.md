# CI/CD in GitHub Workflow

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are essential practices in modern software development. GitHub Workflow provides a powerful and flexible platform for implementing CI/CD pipelines for your projects.

## What is CI/CD?

CI/CD is a software development practice that involves automating the process of building, testing, and deploying code changes. It aims to ensure that code changes are integrated and deployed quickly and reliably.

## GitHub Workflow

GitHub Workflow is a feature provided by GitHub that allows you to define custom workflows for your projects. These workflows are defined using YAML files and can be triggered by various events, such as push events, pull request events, or scheduled events.

## Implementing CI/CD in GitHub Workflow

To implement CI/CD in GitHub Workflow, you need to define a workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/main.yml`) in your repository. This file contains the steps and actions that should be executed when a specific event occurs.
