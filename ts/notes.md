# Typescript 

>It was introduced for implementing type saftety in Javascript.

## Various types
1) number
2) string
3) boolean

## Interface

>Interfaces are like blueprints, that helps for modularization.

## Generics

- A class having generics can accept diff types of datatypes, and can work just like it's intended to.
### Example
```typescript
const d1 = new Tuple<number, boolean, string>(10, true, "Hello");
```
