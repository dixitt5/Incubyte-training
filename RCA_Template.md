## What is the impact: <Sev3>

## Historical Context:
 
_**STILL NO BLAME**_
 
_It’s super useful to know how we ended up in this situation and whether we made past decisions that were the right call at the time, but lead to the current situation._
 
## What went well:
 
_Too often on incidents we focus only on what went wrong. It helps to also note things that went well and note any actions that helped reduce time to fix, time to diagnose, time to failure, etc…_
 
 
## Other Open Action Items:
 
_Non blocking open action items that are needed to follow up for this incident. Any tooling we need to create, documentation that needs to be updated, more thorough fixes that need to be done, or more tests to be written?_
