- cloning gives entire history and all branches
- stores snapshot of the entire state of the project, 
- adds data, almost never deletes stuff
- integrity hash -> for differentiating b/w different commits
- states
  - commited, modified, staged
  - commited -> stores in .git memory (db)
  - 
  - staging == index == cached
- config
  - global --global
  - user --system
  - project (go into directory)
- commit
