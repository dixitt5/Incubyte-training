# React

### CSR vs SSR

### Installation with Vite

> ### What Vite does ? 
> - optimizes the code , minify and compresses the code.
> - therefore no one can reverse engineer the code.

### CDN (Content Delivery Network)

- It is faster and browser can also cache it. (widely spread to servers across the world)

### Virtual DOM

- only renders the component, not the whole dom.

### Enums in TypeScript

```typescript
export enum PokemonType {
  Grass,
  Water,
  Fire,
  Rock,
  Other,
}
```
